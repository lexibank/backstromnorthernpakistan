## Notes

The following location codes from Backstrom and Radloff (1992) were changed in order to serve as unique language IDs:

Language | Location Code | Source ID
--- | --- | ---
Rondu Balti | RON | RON_B
Yasin Center | YAS | YAS_C

Since the source book provides the word lists in the form of phonetic transcription, the data had to be digitized manually. The style of phonetic notation follows the North American tradition. However, documented field transcriptions lack thorough phonological analysis, as noted by the authors. Several graphemes, e.g. `ỵ`, `g̣`, and `ǰ̣ `, were hard to find in digitized NAPA phoneme inventories and thus were recreated by means of Unicode converter.
